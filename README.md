# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
This analysis is done to re assess the Math and Reading scores of Thomas High School on dishonesty alligations and to make sure the School District Metrics are accurate. In this project the Math and Reading scores are replaced with NaNs for all the grades of Thomas High School, after that, a fresh calculation of passing percentages of all the grades in Thomas High School are recalculated and presented as part of the higher analysis.

## Results:
* How is the district summary affected?
  * There is no change in the Avg reading score evem after recalculation, only the avg math score has changed by just a bit. The passing percentages went down in the reclatulation and so as the overall percentage by 0.3%
* How is the school summary affected?
  * Replacing the 9th Grade scores for Thomas High School has brought up the overall passing percentage of the school, yet there is no change in the  math percentage, only the reading percentage has changed.
